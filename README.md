# CHIP-8 Interpreter

A basic **CHIP-8 interpreter** written in C.  
CHIP-8 is a simple interpreted language used in the 1970s for learning and running small games.

Right now, this project includes:
- The core structure of the emulator (memory, registers, display, etc.)
- Partial implementation of opcode handling

### Next steps
- Finish implementing all opcodes  
- Add display rendering and input handling  
- Load and run simple CHIP-8 ROMs
